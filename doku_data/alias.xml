The ##BOTNAME## who says you one alias/nickname has or is one for you :)
An alias is to at least two characters long start with a capital letter and is unique.
	
So he can name Members remember, ##BOTNAME## then know who is meant when one writes Max or he remembers who is most like him ;)

How does that? Quite simply alias is a command and a question at the same time.

If only one [quote][b]Alias[/b][/quote]

If one

With
[quote][b]!Alias[/b] [i]Max[/i][/quote]
which is given unto you alias Max, only if he is already an error message comes!

Oh, as a small tip to the chat not so fully to spamming, you can alias function whisper to the ##BOTNAME##!

Much fun =)
